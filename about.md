Hello I'm Chester,

I'm a software developer that loves problem solving, open source, and cutting edge technologies.  I created this blog to capture things I've learned in hopes that it can help others in the same position. 

I'm always open to feedback so please leave a comment on my posts.

Happy Coding!
