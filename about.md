Hello I'm Chester,

I'm a software developer that loves problem solving, open source, and cutting edge technologies.  I created this blog to capture things I've learned in hopes that it can help others in the same position. 

##What is Coding Velocity?

Truthfully, sometimes I like to string together buzz words that sound smarter than they really are.  When developing one of my posts I used 'Coding Velocity', a coworker loved it so much that I immediately bought the domain name.


I'm always open to feedback so please leave a comment on my posts.

Happy Coding!
