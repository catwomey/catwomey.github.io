Hello I'm Chester,

I'm a software developer with a passion for cool technologies and new ways to improve my workflow. This blog will be a record of useful tools, cool languages, and programming challenges I wish to share.
 
Any opinions expressed in this blog are solely my own and do not reflect any opinions of my current employer.  All code snippets I include on this site are free for anyone to use.
